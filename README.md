# Summary

This is a project I made with my group on Tinder Usage Among College Students using HTML and R

### Domain of Interest:

Our domain of interest is relationships and dating. We are specifically interested in how the increase in popularity of dating apps and online social networking has impacted how people meet and form relationships. This is extremely relevant now because of COVID-19 and the resulting overwhelming shift to online. We hope to answer questions related to how the move to online and app-based dating is changing how people form and maintain relationships.
 
 ### Some data driven projects in this field:
 
 *   [Tinder Revenue and Usage project](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/#1)
 *   [The Dark Side of Tinder: The Dark Triad of Personality as Correlates of Tinder Use](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1027%2F1614-0001%2Fa000297 )
 *   [Social Media Use and Its Impact on Relationships and Emotions](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7927&context=etd)
 
 ### Three questions we had relating to this domain:

*   How many people find a partner online?
*   Are relationships with people in similar income classes more common?
*   Does meeting your partner online affect relationship length?

### We found three datasets to help answer these questions:

*   [How many millennials find someone on tinder](https://data.world/ahalps/how-many-millennials-find-someone-on-tinder) is a study on if respondents have ever met someone off tinder. It also separates data by university, gender or if they are a web or mobile respondent. We downloaded the data from [data.world](https://data.world/ahalps/how-many-millennials-find-someone-on-tinder). The data was collected by the millennial survey company and surveyed by [Adam Halper](https://data.world/ahalps) the company’s CEO. There are 453 observations (rows) in this dataset and 6 features (columns). This dataset can answer the question about how many people find a partner online.
*   The [How Couples Meet and Stay Together (HCMST)](https://knoema.com/izrpacd/how-couples-meet-and-stay-together-january-2014. ) is a study of how Americans meet their spouses and romantic partners and lengths of their relationships. The study includes 4,002 American adults. We found a nice presentation of the data [here](https://knoema.com/izrpacd/how-couples-meet-and-stay-together-january-2014.) and downloaded the actual data [here](https://data.stanford.edu/hcmst2017#download-data). The data is a follow-up study by Stanford based on a 2009 Stanford study about how different couples met and how their relationships have gone since then. This new study features all new survey respondents as well as new questions about subjects’ use of dating apps to meet their partner. The data contains 3510 observations of 285 variables. We can use this dataset to answer the question about how meeting a partner online affects relationship length.
*   The [FiveThirtyEight Marriage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/fivethirtyeight-marriage-dataset) was collected from the Decennial Census (years 1960 to 2000) and the American Community Survey (years 2001-2012). It has many different variables(income, race, education…)  affect the status of the marriage(divorce or non-divorce).We can download this data from the Kaggle website [here](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/fivethirtyeight-marriage-dataset). There are 17 observations(rows) and 10 variables(columns) in the dataset. Questions like “How can family with different levels of income affect marriage status?” can be answered from this data.
